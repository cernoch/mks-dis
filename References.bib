Here we show that recognition of such orders and graphs can be done more efficiently than by using the well-known algorithms based on bipartite matching and matrix multiplication. In particular, we show that deciding deciding if an order has width k can be done in O(kn2) time and whether a graph has Dilworth number k can be done in O(k2n2) time.",

  abstract="This work presents a memory-efficient All-SAT engine which, given a propositional formula over sets of important and non-important variables, returns the set of all the assignments to the important variables, which can be extended to solutions (satisfying assignments) to the formula. The engine is built using elements of modern SAT solvers, including a scheme for learning conflict clauses and non-chronological backtracking. Re-discovering solutions that were already found is avoided by the search algorithm itself, rather than by adding blocking clauses. As a result, the space requirements of a solved instance do not increase when solutions are found. Finding the next solution is as efficient as finding the first one, making it possible to solve instances for which the number of solutions is larger than the size of the main memory.",
